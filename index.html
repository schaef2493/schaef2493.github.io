                    <p>Kinova Robotics recently launched MICO, an innovative wheelchair-mounted robotic arm with a two-fingered hand. MICO was <strong>designed to assist people with paralysis</strong> caused by various neuromuscular disorders. However, its <strong>current control mechanisms are severely lacking in usability</strong> and learnability. The vision of this four month project was to understand the needs of MICO's users, improve its control interface, and develop a vision of where future work should focus.</p>

                    <p>Through talking with people who suffered from spinal cord injuries, we learned that <strong>routine activities of daily living are a constant challenge</strong>. Of those we talked to, most had no control of their arms, except for some level of fine motor control in their fingers. This left people unable to do vital tasks such as drinking a glass of water or opening a door.</p>

                <div class="grid-66">
                    <p>Empowered with real stories about the needs of our users, we began studying the shortcomings of the existing control interface, which uses a <strong>wheelchair-mounted joystick</strong> and allows people to move the arm through various axis, depending on the active control mode.</p>

                    <p>We had our peers attempt to use MICO to perform a basic task, such as picking up a bottle. We heard things like "That was absolutely agonizing." We learned that <strong>the main challenge in using the arm is having to control it through low-level movements</strong> (such as "move left" or "move down"), which conflicts with how people expect to interact with their environment. In fact, controlling the arm was so <strong>cognitively demanding</strong> that it was hard to even carry a conversation at the same time.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-85 prefix-15">
                    <h2>We learned that people want the arm to feel like a natural extension of their body.</h2>

                <div class="grid-66">
                    <p>We decided the best way to achieve this goal would be to <strong>empower people to control the arm through high level commands</strong> (such as "open the door"). This would free people to think about the task at hand, rather than how to accomplish it.</p>

                    <p>We began exploring ways of allowing people to <strong>record and play back their most routine daily tasks</strong>. We intended this solution to work in tandem with a person's existing wheelchair control so it could be customized to an individual's unique needs.</p>

                    <p>Through user studies, we found that <strong>no one preferred using the recorded tasks.</strong> People said that they didn't feel in control when playing back a task and often failed to complete the task because they had <strong>no way to make live adjustments to recordings.</strong></p>

                <div class="grid-66">
                    <p>We decided to push forward. After studying the results of our user studies, we went back to the drawing board. To help people feel more in control during playback, we redesigned the control to <strong>use the wheelchair's joystick to advance or rewind playback</strong>. If the joystick was released, playback would immediately pause. This also lent itself to a <strong>clearer conceptual model,</strong> where the joystick is exclusively used to control the arm.</p>

                    <p>To allow users to make adjustments during playback, <strong>we introduced arm mode control buttons</strong> onscreen. If tapped during playback, the arm would <strong>switch into a manual control mode to allow for adjustments</strong>. Then the recording could be immediately resumed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="grid-33 videoCaption">
                    <p>To evaluate our redesign, we conducted a larger scale study with ten people. Each person was asked to move a bottle using the existing control (direct manipulation) and our redesigned control (automated task), while having to make adjustments.</p>

                    <p>To measure cognitive demand, we had participants complete a NASA Task Load Index survey between trials.</p>

                    <p>These results were <strong>corroborated through our follow up interviews.</strong> One 22 year old, Jason, said "It was definitely easier to use the recording. The joystick was difficult to use in comparison," a sentiment that was shared by many participants. Further, <strong>all participants were able to successfully make adjustments</strong> to a recording and complete the task.</p>

                    <p>Overall, we believe that our evidence offers an overwhelming amount of support for introducing automated tasks as a way to <strong>dramatically lower the cognitive demand</strong> required to use the MICO arm.</p>

                    <p>Previously, instructors tried to reduce their workload by <strong>instituting a peer grading system,</strong> where students anonymously graded their peers.

                    <p>In classrooms focused on the needs of children with autism, <strong>teachers tailor performance goals to each of their students.</strong> To track progress, teachers are required to collect an enormous amount of individualized behavioral data.</p>

                    <p><strong>Teachers collect behavioral data with pen and paper</strong>, creating a mountain of paperwork. After school, they spend several hours simply hand graphing data points and tracking student progress.</p>

                    <p>We conducted <strong>extensive ethnography</strong> in these schools to identify why previous attempts to digitize data collection had failed. Informed by our findings, we <strong>designed a prototype iPad app,</strong> Zephyr, aimed at improving data collection.</p>

                    <p>We learned from speaking with teachers that we should <strong>not design a tool that attempts to outsmart the teacher,</strong> but rather a tool that recognizes the importance of human expertise in making decisions.</p>

                    <p>We identified several reasons that past attempt to digitize data collection processes had failed. First, <strong>data needs are complex and not standardized</strong> between classrooms. No current software had been designed to support this level of complexity and customization. Second, it can be <strong>difficult to collect data while dealing with frequent interruptions</strong> in the classroom.</p>
